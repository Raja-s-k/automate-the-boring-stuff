→&nbsp;Functions makes our code neat and tidy\
&ensp;&ensp;→&nbsp;It also makes the code easier to debug.  

**2)**
When the function is called.  

**3)**
def statement is used to create a function.\
**Syntax:**
def < name of the function >(< parameter1 >,< parameter1 >,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;)&nbsp;:

**4)**
A function is a program or a code block which is defined seperatly outside the main program
and runs only if the particular function is called ,whereas a function call is used to call a function
form the main program.

**5)**
There is only one global scope in python ie)the main program itself can be considered as 
a global scope. There can be infinetly many local scope in a program.

**6)**
When a function is defined in the main program a local scope is created. The variables inside 
the function are called as the local variables. When the function call returns these local 
variable gets destroyed or the python forgets these variables.

**7)**
A return value can be treated as a output value of a function when the fuction is exectued. Yes, 
return value can also be an expression.

**8)**
None

**9)**
Using global function.

**10)**
None is a datatype does not contain any value in it.

**11)**
import areallyourpetsnamederic statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic which
indirectly imports all the fuctions from areallyourpetsnamederic module.

**13)**
We can prevent a program from crashing by using the try and except clause.

**14)**
First try clause is executed. If there is no exception, then the try clause will run, and the
except clause will not get executed. If any exception occurs, then the try clause will be skipped
 and except clause will run. So, the try clause contains the main program and the 
except clause contains the continution of the main program from where their can be a
chance of error.
