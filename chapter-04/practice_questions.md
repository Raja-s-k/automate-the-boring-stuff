**1)**
A list is datatype which stores the elements is square brackets. They are mutable. So, the 
values inside a list can be modified. 

**2)**
By using the statment **spam.insert(2,"hello")**

**3)**
d

**4)**

**5)**
['a','b']

**6)**
1

**7)**
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

**8)**
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

**9)**
The operator for concatenating a list is **"+"** and the operator for the list replication is 
**"*"**

**10)**\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;append() - append() function is used to add or insert an element at the end of the list. It carries only one 
parameter with it which is the element itself.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;insert() - insert() function is used to add or insert an element at a particular index. It 
carries two parameter, the first prameter is the index at which the element should be inserted
and the second parameter is the element to be inserted.

**11)**
There are two fuctions to remove an element from a list.\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;→remove()\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;→pop()  

remove() - remove() function carries one parameter which is the element itself.\
pop() - pop() fuction also carries one parameter which is the index of the element to 
be poped out.

**12)**
The same concatination operator(+) is used for concatinating two strings or two lists. And for both
string and list * operator is used for replication. len() function is also common for lists
and string.

**13)**
Lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable.

**14)**
(42,)

**15)**
Using tuple() and list() functions respectively.

**16)**
Since those values are stored inside a list, the variable have only access to the list. And 
the values can be accessed by using their respective indeces.

**17)**
The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() 
function will do a deep copy of a list ie, it will duplicate any lists inside that list also.
